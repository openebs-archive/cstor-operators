# Pool Operation Hung Due to Bad Disk

As of now, cStor scans all the devices on the node when it tries to import the pool in case of a pool manager pod
restart.

Pool is always imported before creation. For the first time, when the pool creation happens, all of the 
devices are scanned and as there is not a existing pool, a fresh pool is created. Now, when the pool is created the 
particiapting devices are chached for faster import of the pool (in case the pool manager pod restarts). Now if the 
import happens by using the cache then this problem will not occur but there is a chance of import without cache (when 
pool is being created for the first time)

So in a case when pool import happens without cache file and any of the devices(even the devices that are not part of 
the cStor pool) are bad and is not responding the command issued by cStor keeps on waiting and is stuck. As a result of 
this, pool manager pod is not able to issue any more command in order to reconcile the state of cStor pools or even 
perform the IO for the volumes that are placed on that particular pool. 

A fix on this is being worked upon and more details can be found in the following link:

# How to recover from this situation?

Now there could be two different situations :

1. The device that has gone bad is actually a part of the cStor pool on the node. If this is the case
then see [Block Device Replacement](../tutorial/cspc/tuning/tune.md) in this tutorial. This tutorial is for
`mirror` RAID but similar approach can be followed for other RAID configurations like `raidz1` and `raidz2`. 

**Note:** Block device replacement is not supported for `stripe` raid configuration. Please visit this [link]
(migrate_cstor_pools.md) for some use cases and solutions around this.

2. The device that has gone bad is not part of the cStor pool on the node. in this case, perform the following steps
to recover from this situation:
- Remove the bad disk from the node.
- Restart the pool manager pod.
