NOTE: The test cases adjusts depending on the number of nodes
in the Kubernetes cluster.
Meaning, if only 1 node is present then the test result expectations(output)
are in accordance with what it should be with 1 node.

if only 3 node is present then the test result expectations(output)
are in accordance with what it should be with 3 node.

Before starting the test suite, it should be specified whether it is
a 3 node or 1 node test.

Test suite only supports either a 1 node or 3 node test.
